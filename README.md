# Probabilistic approach to catalyst activity estimation for chemical reactors
This repository contains several methods to estimate the catalyst activity of a chemical reactor.
- Linear System Identification approach.
- Gaussian Process bases system identification using Reduced Rank method.
- Partial differential equation parameter estimation with latent force.

To use this package, please install the following prerequisities:

1. `SIPPY` package from [github](https://github.com/CPCLAB-UNIPI/SIPPY). Follow the instruction there.
2. `Numba` version should be later than `0.47`.
3. `Pytorch`
4. `tqdm`
5.
